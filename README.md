Part One

Route between 2 components depending on the path:
  1. Home page ("/")
  2. Products Page ("/products")
  
  ** Home Page **
  • Can be a basic home page, maybe welcoming the user to your site and giving some background about yourself 
  	as a developer
  
  ** Products Page **
  • Using an array of data for your products (provided for you), 
    map over that data to show each item and some information on the products 
    page as a list of available products.

Part Two

 * Challenge:
  
 1. Create a ProductDetail component
 2. Link each product name to a detail page of that product 
    under the route "/products/{insert product id here}" (e.g.: "/products/2")
 3. Clicking the product name should replace the product list page with
    the detail page of that component.
